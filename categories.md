* information-based: people exchange or collect pieces of information, collected information is usually more than a single person could know or find out in a reasonable amount of time  
    + exchanging individual strategies  
    + collective sensemaking  
    + aggregating data, e.g. data cooperatives  

* strategy-based: people agree upon and execute a joint strategy beyond sharing information. In most cases this requires a certain amount of coordination and oftentimes the strategy is time-dependent e.g. happens on a specific day  
    + data poisoning: inserting inaccurate or harmful training data [0]   
    + data obfuscation: producing misleading, false, or ambiguous data with the intention of confusing an adversary or simply adding to the time or cost of separating bad data from good [1]  
    + algorithmic leverage: strategically exploiting features of an algorithm in order to influence the outcome to the group's or a group member's benefit, either through coordinated use of a feature (as a group), overusing a feature or not using a feature
