# Twitter – Voldemorting

## Description

Voldemorting refers to the practice of not mentioning words or names on Twitter in order to avoid a forced connection [0]. The term goes back to the Harry Potter book series by J.K. Rowling.   
Instead users invent alternative, often fantasy words, which they propagate among their sub-community. For instance in the #Gamergate controversy (hateful backlash against woman participating in video game culture) people started using hashtags like #Goobergate, #Gatergate, #GG in order to avoid attention from harassing opponents [0]. So to speak, Voldemorting is a way to hide in plain sight. This tactic was also referred to as the „ultimate anti-SEO“ which transforms a keyword into an „ungraspable swarm“ [1].
