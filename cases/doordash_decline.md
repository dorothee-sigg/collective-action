# DoorDash – \#DeclineNow

## Description

In 2019 two DoorDash drivers, Dave Levy and Nikos Kanelopoulos, started the campaign #DeclineNow. Since then they constantly try to persuade their peer Dashers – as DoorDash driver are called – to reject low-paying deliveries. They hypothesize that the DoorDash algorithm responds by increasing the payment.   
As a pinned statement from their facebook group reads: „The fundamental principles of the OFFICIAL #DECLINENOW movement rely upon all drivers in the movement to exercise their right to use the decline button to decline lowball offers for higher, more logistically feasible and profitable ones. Declining lowball offers FORCES the algorithm to raise the base pay UP on the declined offer for SUBSEQUENT drivers as the NEED for DoorDash to service the order increases.“   
This is similar to a reverse auction: If no driver wants to delivery the order at the given price the price gets increased up until a driver is willing to deliver it. There is no way of knowing from the outside if this the algorithm really works that way. However, Levy and Kanelopoulos as well as other drivers experienced this, namely when one driver declines an orders it is often re-offered to another driver with slightly increased payment of e.g. $0.25.   
The two initiators are now trying to get as many Dashers as possible to decline orders below the threshold of $7 – while DoorDash’s official minimum base pay (i.e. without tips or bonuses) is at $2 [1].   

Furthermore, DoorDash sometimes obscures the full amount of payment by hiding part of the payment into what is called a ‚hidden tip‘. For instance, you may accept an order at a guaranteed amount of $10 but upon completion you get noticed that the order pays $15. This means a constant gamble for the drivers, which led to the drivers’ nickname for the company, “Tony’s Casino,” a reference to Chief Executive Officer Tony Xu [0].    
One article from February 2021 [2] reports that back then drivers could hack this hidden tip by using an older version of the app and an extra Android phone. With the extra information it was easier for #DeclineNow drivers to selectively accept orders. However, to my knowledge this trick is not working anymore [3].  

The same article [2] mentions an experiment carried out by drivers organized in a facebook group. One half of the group accepted every order while the other half selectively declined low-paying orders. Results were that drivers who accepted everything earned $0.68 per mile with a gross hourly wage of $12.41. Drivers who selectively declined earned $1.26 per mile with a gross hourly wage of $21.15. However, I was not able to find more information about this experiment.   

There is a another campaign by Working Washington which essentially propagates the same strategy of „joining together to make DoorDash pay up by rejecting ALL jobs that offer less than $6“ [4]. Additionally the campaign suggests to reject all offers that pay less than $1 per mile of driving. They coined the hashtag #NoFreeLunch for their campaing.    
Interested readers may also have a look at the corresponding Working Washingtons data analysis about Dasher pay [5]. To my knowledge this is a unique data collection in the sense that it provides pay data from  Dashers itself – which turn out to be in extreme contrast to what DoorDash promotes.   


## Aspects of Coordination 

#DeclineNow is mainly organized via a facebook group with 40,000+ members. The group has very strict rules and moderators regularly kick out people for not complying with these rules [0]. For instance, it is not allowed to promote high acceptance rates since this is supposed to be in direct contradiction with declining. Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Hastings Law, comments that „it’s actually quite hard to get people to adhere to these types of collective actions if there’s not some kind of consequence“ [0].   
The group also serves to support each other and members regularly post unacceptable orders beyond fair pay.   

The #NoFreeLunch campaign offers a web-based interface to enter the zip-code if you are a participating driver. A map indicates how many drivers are already participating in the US.   Currently (August 2023) there are roughly 1800 registered participants.
