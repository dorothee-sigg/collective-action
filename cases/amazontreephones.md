# Amazon Flex Treephones

## Description

A newspaper article from September 2020 [0] reports that Amazon Flex drivers were hanging phones in trees in front of Whole Foods stores (belong to Amazon since 2017) and Amazon delivery stations in Chicago. Drivers who are in on the scheme can then sync their phones with the devices in the trees. Amazon’s dispatch system for so called ‚instant offers‘ passes offers to drivers near the delivery station. Thus, by syncing their phones with the tree-phones drivers hope to beat out competing drivers and get more orders. It might also be the case that this strategy allows the drivers to work elsewhere while the tree-phone secures the next orders for them.   
Note that this strategy is exclusively to the detriment of other drivers, who will then receive no or fewer orders. Other sources suggest that competition among workers is really high and that there are several other strategies, such as bots and scripts, to secure jobs before others do [1].   

However, the case of the tree-phones is not that clear. Another theory [0] for the tree-phones suggest that the phones are organized by an intermediary person which is charging money from the drivers for securing more orders. Moreover, this could also be a way for people to work which are otherwise not allowed to work for Amazon Flex (e.g. undocumented people). The intermediary could resell the routes to them and pocket the difference.

On reddit Amazon Flex drivers discuss (and doubt) the credibility of this story [2]. 

## Collective?

The tree-phones seem to serve multiple drivers. So, even though the drivers are competing against each other for orders they collectively use the phones, or at least tolerate that others do the same strategy. One aspect might also be that likewise hanging one phone for many drivers or hanging one phone for each driver could be easier for Amazon to detect. [0]   

## Countermeasures

An article from Spencer Soper, the journalist who wrote the original Bloomberg article, suggests that a couple of days after the article Amazon seemingly created a ‚dead zone‘ around Whole Food stores and delivery stations [3]. This means that within that area drivers will not receive instant offers. This is not just a remedy to the tree-phone incident but also to the larger problem of workers crowding the parking lots waiting for jobs.  
Posts on reddit support that [4]. Furthermore, as one reddit user suspects this countermeasure might not be very sustainable: „…eventually someone will figure out 3 miles or whatever is the minimum and just find a new place to camp there. I don’t think amazon really cares beyond keeping them out of the parking lot.“ [4]
