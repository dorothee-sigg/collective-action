# Upwork Collective Sensemaking

## Description

Jarrahi and Sutherland (2019) [0] interview freelance workers on Upwork, an US-based freelancing platform. They find that not only do many workers spend considerable amount of time and effort to understand the exact workings of the algorithms (e.g. how their job success score is influenced) but also that they share their insights in online forums. For instance, on interviewed freelancer said that only via the forum he learned that most of the jobs on Upwork are hidden, and can only be acquired by invitation from clients, not through the usual procedure.
