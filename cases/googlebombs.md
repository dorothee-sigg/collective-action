# Google Bombs

## Description

Google bomb refers to „the practice of causing a website to rank highly in web search engine results for irrelevant, unrelated or off-topic search terms by linking heavily“ [0]. Most known Google bombs are motivated by political activism, commercial use [0] or for humorous purposes [1].  

One prominent example is about the former US senator Rick Santorum. After he made a homophobic statement in 2003 the blogger and journalist Dan Savage successfully redefined the name of Rick Santorum. Savage and his readership made a collective effort to spread the new definition – by clicking, rephrasing or linking the website. For nearly a decade the website with his definition was at the top of google’s search results for ‚Rick Santorum‘. Then, during 2012 Republican nominations the website dropped in ranking – potentially due to an update in the Google’s page rank algorithm. Gillespie (2017) [2] provides a very detailed analysis about this case.   

Around the same time the Blogger George Johnston [3] successfully linked the search term ‚miserable failure‘ to the entry of George W. Bush’s biography on the White House website. Interestingly one still finds Johnston’s original call for action [4]:
