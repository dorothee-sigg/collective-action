# Upwork – Off-Platform Work

## Description

Jarrahi and Sutherland (2019) [0] report that freelancers on Upwork shift work contracts with clients off the platform in order to avoid the platform’s commission fee. Rahman (2019) also names paranoia, uneasiness, and overall superstitions freelancers developed towards the platform as a reason to attempt to take their work off the platform [1]. 
The workers use the platform for matching between worker and client and the carefully suggest to move off-platform. This is risky because it is usually not allowed [1] and the legal protections and insurances provided by the platform don’t cover any more.

## Aspects of Coordination

As Jarrahi and Sutherland [0] report from one interviewee: "Well after the first time they actually see that I’m not a freak and I do a good job and will do the work that’s when I’ll usually ask." (p. 584)
