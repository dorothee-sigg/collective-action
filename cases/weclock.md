# WeClock 

## Description

WeClock is a self-tracking app [0], not only for gig workers but for employees in general. The goal is to enable workers to „ collect information about their daily life and use it to measure their working conditions. It takes the sensors that are sitting on your smartphone, the apps you use, your location, how your battery is being used, and gives you the opportunity to collect and share that with other workers and organizers“ [1]. This should not only give insights for a single worker but also empower unions and equip them with the necessary data backing for campaigning [2]. In that way it can spark and support collective action. In their ‚Onboarding Kit for Trade Unions’ [2] they explicitly encourage unions to use the app in to tackle wage theft and worker wellbeing issues.
The code is open-source [3] and they claim that the data is stored securely in a privacy-preserving way.
