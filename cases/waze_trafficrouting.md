# Waze – Traffic Routing

## Description

Waze is a Google-owned navigation tool that is based on crowd-sourcing. It collects GPS navigation data in real-time, such as route duration, traffic congestion, road obstacles, and even map layout from users. This information is then used to route other users. It therefore finds the short ways which usually are only known by locals [0]: If for instance a major highway is blocked the app may offer an alternative route. In some cities this resulted in crowded streets in formerly quiet residential neighborhoods [1], or small streets not designed for heavy or regular traffic. In extreme cases residents could not leave their homes with their own cars because streets were heavily blocked.   
The Washington Post tells the story of a residents that report false traffic obstacles in his neighborhood in the attempt of tricking the app [0]. After two weeks he was kicked off the platform as a saboteur. Not only are traffic reports from a single source quickly overruled by the wisdom of the crowd but also easily detectable by Waze.   
However, a collective attempt could be more effective. There is a short newspaper article which reports about a neighborhood in L.A. who tried exactly that, uniting to report congestion in their area so cars are rerouted back to other streets [1].   
Waze claims that it is „not possible to fool the system for long“ [0] since (i) information gets overruled by others and (ii) it can detect whether you are in motion or not. The latter seems to be a critical point which leads to two attempts to circumvent that.  
In 2014, two students from Israel created ‚driver bots‘ by using free off-the-shelf emulation software [2]. They explored different traffic scenarios by simulating driving behavior of the bots. Some of the scenarios successfully led to traffic jams. This also led to different route recommendation on Waze. Furthermore, with their bots they reported artificial police units or hazards which then showed up in the map. This is a proof of concept as they conducted their experiments on the otherwise empty university campus.  
In a 2020 published video, a Berlin artist slowly carried 99 cell phones over the street. Subsequently the street changed in Google Maps from ‚green‘ to ‚red‘ – traffic jam [3] . However, he apparently chose the road conditions very carefully and admitted that it would not have worked if, for example, another car had passed at normal speed [4].
