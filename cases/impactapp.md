# Impact App

## Description

Impact is a prototype app to organize supporters on social media which should promote political messages [0]. The messages are generated by AI and the goal is to coordinatedly flood social media to game the algorithm and to help certain political topics gain attention.   

On the one hand, users can register to be a 'supporter'. By providing some onboarding data users will get targeted suggestions for action requests. On the other hand, initiatives and organizations can register and generate action requests to raise attention to a topic/post the initiative cares about. They can access a AI-assisted dashboard to manage supporters, e.g. they can enter a phrase describing the ideal supporter they want to target with their campaign. An AI-based algorithm then selects suitable supporters based on the phrase.   
Subsequently, supporters receive the action item together with an AI-generated message suggestions which is different for each supporter. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for the supporters to just copy and paste the text.   

So far the app is a prototype, and the information on their website is minimal [1]. Critics are concerned about the effect of AI-generated messages en masse which could potentially further blur the line between authentic and inauthentic behaviour on social media [0]. Furthermore, it is currently unclear if initiatives have to pay to use the service of the app.
