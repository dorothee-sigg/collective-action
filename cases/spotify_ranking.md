# Spotify – Song Ranking

## Description

In March 2022, Brazilian singer Anitta asks her fans to push her song ‚Envolver‘ by repeated listening, making playlists with that song, and even using multiple accounts to do that [0]. That is, to extensively use all mechanisms they are aware of and of which they assume that the algorithm uses them for ranking.  
Also she set up a contest among their fans where they could win a Spotify subscription.
Success: The song made it to the first place on the Spotify charts ranking.
