# Instagram – Engagement Pods

## Description

An Instagram or engagement pod is a peer community (or ‘pod’) of Instagram users who band together to help increase engagement on each other’s content. This can be done through liking, commenting, sharing or otherwise engaging with each others content. Pods are organized everywhere on social media platforms, e.g. on the Instagram messenger itself, Telegram, Facebook or Reddit [0].   
O’Meara analyzes [0] these pods as „cooperative algorithm hacking“. Influencers on Instagram face „proprietary curation algorithms [which] wrest knowledge and control of the labor process from producers“.   
By increasing engagement through the pod the influencers try to escape the „threat of invisibility“ and for instance being ranked down by the algorithm.   

Pod sizes range from tens to thousands. They usually are centered around specific content, e.g. cooking. Also, as the timing of liking/commenting after a post ‚drops‘ (is released) appears to be crucial. Most of the pods have specific rules about that [1], i.e. members have to comment/like/share within a specific timeframe after the post is released. Participants get warned or kicked out if they do not comply. In [1] a blogger who joined a couple of pods shares her experience and describes it as very stressful to engage with hundreds of posts in that given timeframe.
