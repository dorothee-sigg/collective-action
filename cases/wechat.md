# China: WeChat groups, Knights League

## Description

Chinese ridesharing and on-demand delivery drivers organize in WeChat groups, a popular messenger service in China. According to Sun (2019) [0] a delivery worker usually joins two or three WeChat groups on food delivery. They share information about tactics of delivery, experience in communicating with customers [0], temporary subsidies, equipment assistance, newcomer help, real-time traffic news and help each other in emergencies [1]. Also, they collectively try to unpack the platforms’ algorithm, since many of the workers only get a minimum training of 1 hour how to use the platform [1]. Sun describes this practice of sensemaking as inventing „labor algorithms“ which have labor as input and income as output. By ‚inputting‘ different labour practices and observing the output the workers were able to work out the underlying mechanisms.    

Probably the largest group is the Knight League, also known as Delivery Knights Alliance. It emerged gradually during 2018 from a WeChat group and was officially established in 2019 by Chen Guojiang [2]. Nowadays it has more the status of an informal labor union.   
According to Qiu (2022) [3] the Knights League has approximately 14,000 members (at least back in 2021), most of which where working for Ele.me, the second largest on-demand food delivery service in China.     

## Aspects of Coordination

According to Yu [1] one coordination strategy of the Knight League was to print QR codes and attaching them to delivery bags and bikes. This turned out to be an effective strategy for recruiting new members. Furthermore, they used Douyin (known as TikTok outside of China). One of the founding members shared his daily work experiences on his Douyin account and promoted the Knight League to reach prospective members.
