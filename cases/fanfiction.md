# Fan Fiction Writers — Confusing Stories

## Description

A group of fan fiction writers was upset about A.I. companies scraping and using their data (obviously without consent) to feed their language models and producing competitive content. In July 2023, they organized an act of rebellion and roughly a dozen of fan fiction writers published irreverent stories online „to overwhelm and confuse the data-collection services that feed writers’ work into AI technology“.
