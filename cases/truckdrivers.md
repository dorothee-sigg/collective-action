# Truck Drivers Facing Surveillance

## Background

Trucks in the U.S. are more and more equipped with an electronic logging device (ELD). In her book "Data driven: truckers, technology, and the new workplace surveillance" (2023) [0], Levy shares her insights on this technological transition from three years of fieldwork research. 

In the first place, ELDs should monitor the driving hours of truck drivers which underly strict regulation: how many driving hours are allowed without a break, how long the break has to be etc. In the past, truck drivers recorded this on a paper logbook. Since 2017, there is the ELD mandate which requires that all truckers buy, install, and use ELDs.  
While at first glance it may seem reasonable to enforce regulations on driving hours, this in fact poses a huge problem to truck drivers. Drivers face strong economic pressure implicitly or explicitly from their companies to meet deadlines, stay longer on the road, or simply to make a living. Concerns such as finding a parking space become increasingly difficult when every minute on the logbook counts. A study found that roughly three-quarters of drivers admitted to violating the hours-of service regulations – tweaking the paper logbooks has a long tradition. With ELDs this is not possible anymore.  
Instead of addressing the underlying conditions that give rise to lawbreaking, regulators and companies have tried to make it more difficult for truckers to cheat on their time records.

Additionally, ELDs do not only record driving hours. In practice, they capture a whole range of other information, far beyond driving hours. It can include a driver’s fuel efficiency and idling time, speed, geolocation and geofencing (notifying a dispatcher if a truck has departed from a predetermined route), lane departures and braking/acceleration patterns, freight status (such as the temperature of a refrigerated trailer), tire inflation, vehicle maintenance and diagnostic information. Additionally, some systems have dashboard cameras, facing outward to capture the road and facing inward to record the driver. 
According to Levy these systems however fail to capture relevant information, e.g. the time a driver spends until the truck is (un-)loaded – time which is usually unpaid for a driver.  
Truck drivers who oftentimes chose this professiong for its independece find their truck (workplace and living place at the same time) under increasing surveillance. However, with the widespread adoption of ELDs in the industry, strategies for noncompliance and resistance have also developed. Here is a selection of collective strategies, not all of them explicitly work on an algorithmic level. 

## Description

1. C**ollective brute-force destruction**    
A former driver reports that when his firm rolled out timing devices for all their trucks all drivers engaged in a collective action: They disabled the device by hitting it with a hammer. After a week, the company gave up, presumably assuming that the devices did not work.  

2. **Collective information sharing: Exchanging of individual strategies** 
Truck drivers share their tips on how to get rid of tracking tools by posting it to message boards. For instance, they share which wires to unplug, or how to wrap Aluminum foil around a device to prevent it from transmitting information. 

3. **Sharing log-in information**    
To authenticate themselves, drivers typically need to log into the system using a username and password with the majority of ELDs. Drivers have often access to multiple usernames and passwords, potentially because drivers share them among each other. This is useful when a driver has reached the legal driving limits but has reason to continue (e.g. because he needs to drive to a parking lot). Then he can log off and log in under a different username without going beyond his driving limits. 

4. **Slow roll #BlackSmokeMatters**   
In 2019, within a facebook group of 25,000 members, truckers organized a "slow roll" around Indianapolis. The idea was to protest by rolling on the minimum allowable highway speed (45 mile per hour) to raise awareness around the ELD prolematic. In the end, there were only 78 drivers participating. Very similar turnouts happened at a slow roll in Chicago. Having had a nationwide shutdown in mind as a lever to the ELD politics the organizers admitted that it did not turn out to make a significant impact. 

5. **Collaboration between drivers and truck stops**   
An interesting strategy arises from the collaboration between truck drivers and truck stops. The logs of truck drivers are regularly being checked by law enforcement officers, regardless if the log is paper-based or electronic. The driver has to supply documents that verify the log. Truckers are required to keep these documents to help the inspector assess whether the driver’s logs are accurate with respect to when he was at a given location. This could be documents such as bills, toll slips or receipts for fuel or other goods.
