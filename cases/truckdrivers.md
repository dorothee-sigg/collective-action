# Truck Drivers Facing Surveillance

## Background

Trucks in the U.S. are more and more equipped with an electronic logging device (ELD). In the first place, this should monitor the driving hours of truck drivers which underly strict regulation: how many driving hours are allowed without a break, how long the break has to be etc. In the past, truck drivers recorded this on a paper logbook. Since 2017, there is the ELD mandate which requires that all truckers buy, install, and use ELDs.  
In practice however, these ELDs capture a whole range of information, far beyond driving hours. It can include a driver’s fuel efficiency and idling time, speed, geolocation and geofencing (notifying a dispatcher if a truck has departed from a predetermined route), lane departures and braking/acceleration patterns, freight status (such as the temperature of a refrigerated trailer), tire inflation, vehicle maintenance and diagnostic information [0]. Additionally, some systems have dashboard cameras, facing outward to capture the road and facing inward to record the driver. 
According to Levy [0] these systems however fail to capture relevant information, e.g. the time a driver spends until the truck is (un-)loaded – time which is usually unpaid for a driver.  
Truck drivers who oftentimes chose this professiong for its independece find their truck (workplace and living place at the same time) under increasing surveillance. However, with the widespread adoption of ELDs in the industry, strategies for noncompliance and resistance have also developed.
TODO: write why this electronic logging of hours is a problem to them, how they relied on paper logs to make (cheat) their work

## Description

1. Collective brute-force destruction  
A former driver reports that when his firm rolled out timing devices for all their trucks all drivers engaged in a collective action: They disabled the device by hitting it with a hammer. After a week, the company gave up, presumably assuming that the devices did not work.  

2. Collective information sharing
Truck drivers share their tips on how to get rid of tracking tools by posting it to message boards. For instance, they share which wires to unplug, or how to wrap Aluminum foil around a device to prevent it from transmitting information. 

3.   
To authenticate themselves, drivers typically need to log into the system using a username and password with the majority of ELDs. Drivers have often access to multiple usernames and passwords, potentially because drivers share them among each other. This is useful when a driver has reached the legal driving limits but has reason to continue (e.g. because he needs to drive to a parking lot). Then he can log off and log in under a different username without going beyond his driving limits. 

4. Slow roll #BlackSmokeMatters
In 2019, within a facebook group of 25,000 members, truckers organized a "slow roll" around Indianapolis. The idea was to protest by rolling on the minimum allowable highway speed (45 mile per hour) to raise awareness around the ELD prolematic. In the end, there were only 78 drivers participating. Very similar turnouts happened at a slow roll in Chicago. Having had a nationwide shutdown in mind as a lever to the ELD politics the organizers admitted that it did not turn out to make a significant impact. 

5. Collaboration between drivers and truck stops
An interesting strategy arises from the collaboration between truck drivers and truck stops. The logs of truck drivers are regularly being checked by law enforcement officers, regardless if the log is paper-based or electronic. The driver has to supply documents that verify the log. Truckers are required to keep these documents to help the inspector assess whether the driver’s logs are accurate with respect to when he was at a given location. This could be documents such as bills, toll slips or receipts for fuel or other goods. 

Truckers engage in a unique resistance strategy by collaborating with truck stops to manipulate time logs during inspections. Law enforcement officers checking a driver's time logs request documents to verify recent whereabouts, and truckers use various records, including bills of lading and fuel receipts from truck stops, to support log accuracy assessments. Some truck stops facilitate this strategy by providing receipts that specify location and date without an exact time, catering to truckers' interest in maintaining flexible time logs. Recognizing that numerous truckers sometimes are in need to maintain flexible time logs, certain truck stops started issuing receipts indicating the location and date of a transaction without specifying the exact time.

Message boards are replete with drivers anonymously shar- ing tips for tampering with GPS receivers and other tracking technologies:
fyi, there are TWO power wires so if you are thinking of unpluggin [sic] from the fuse panel you have to unplug both of them, with one unplugged the keyboard will appear dead but the system can still record certain things, the company you work for can still query the system directly and get a response[.] with both wires unplugged the system is completely shut down, at least the older systems are. one wire is a 5 amp and the other is 25 amp.
on most systems you can also turn the key on and off several times and it will shut the system down, I do this a lot to conserve on battery power.
just do as I do and wrap a piece of Aluminum foil around it and secure it with small bungy cords. this will stop the Transmit and receive but, it will not prevent it from recording your speed or how many times you stop.

This said, departure from a firm can serve as a form of resistance against that firm’s electronic monitoring policies. Initially—before ELDs were man- dated by the government—a number of drivers told me that they had left firms when those firms installed them, or that they would quit if their current carrier did so. 

In early 2019, some truckers took a different tack, taking their ELD frustrations to the streets—specifically, to the I-465 beltway that loops around Indianapolis. Truckers used a twenty-five-thousand-member Facebook group called #BlackSmokeMatters (an offensive reference to #BlackLivesMatter protests also occurring across the country at this time) to organize a “slow roll” on February 12: a protest in which truckers would drive the minimum allowable highway speed, forty-five miles per hour, as a way to raise aware- ness among the general public about the ELD requirement and what they saw as government overreach.
But in the end, the protest drew merely seventy- eight trucks—delaying traffic only slightly.35 A few weeks later, the Facebook group organized another slow roll in Chicago, with similarly meager turnout. Organizers had thought the slow rolls could set the stage for a nationwide shutdown. But they called off those plans, acknowledging that the numbers “were nowhere near what we needed” to make an impact.36 “We lost the fight,” one of the group’s founders said, noting that he was “disappointed and heartbroken” that the slow roll wasn’t more effective as a way to resist electronic monitoring.


A particularly interesting resistance strategy involves behind-the-scenes cooperation between truckers and a surprising third party: truck stops. When a law enforce- ment officer inspects a driver’s time logs—in paper or electronic form—they ask the driver for documents that verify his recent whereabouts. Truckers are required to keep these documents to help the inspector assess whether the driver’s logs are accurate with respect to when he was at a given location. The kinds of documents truckers can use to fill these requirements could include bills of lading, toll slips, inspection records, and—importantly—receipts for fuel or other services at truck stops. Because truckers stop at truck stops frequently to refuel, buy food, take showers, or for other reasons, drivers commonly keep such receipts in the cab.Knowing that many truckers have an interest in “flexibly” logging their time, some truck stops began providing receipts that list a location and date—but not an exact time—at which a transaction occurred
