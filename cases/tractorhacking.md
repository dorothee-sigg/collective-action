# John Deere Tractorhacking

## Description

John Deere has very strict security on the electrical components of its tractors which doesn’t allow the owner of a tractor to repair simple things or upgrade the software. Instead farmers should actually call an authorized John Deere technician. This takes time and is costly.   
Also, this is not only annoying to the farmers but also to independent mechanics which are not authorized by John Deere. According to Vice (2017) [0] many of them use hacked John Deere software – hacked in eastern Europe countries like Ukraine or Poland.   
As an example, there is one open-source github repository which provides a diagnostic tool for „collecting large amounts data from tractors to uncover and interpret the proprietary communication commands [of John Deere tractors]“ [1].   
Many farmers advocate right to repair legislation. There is even a trade organization, repair.org [2], fighting for this very profound right – being allowed to repair things you own.
