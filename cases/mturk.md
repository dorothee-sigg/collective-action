# Amazon Mechanical Turk – Forums and Ratings

## Description

There are several platform on which the clickworkers working for Amazon Mechanical Turk (sometimes called Turkers) socialize, support each other, share advice and individual strategies: MTurkForum [0], r/TurkerNation (on Reddit) [1], MTurkCrowd [2], TurkerView [3], Turkopticon [4].   

From the perspective of collective action, two forums are especially interesting:   

Turkerview is a 2016 worker-founded forum where users can give ratings for requesters (this is the term for people who post tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk), and share information on pay and safety standards of a task. By aggregating this data Turkerview provides detailed information on which requesters pay how much on average and which tasks are safe to do. Turkerview claims to „find requesters worth working with“. This knowledge about the requesters is made possible through collective data aggregation.   
According to their website 30,000+ requesters have been reviewed by using 750,000+ individual reviews from 20,000+ Turkerview users.    

Turkopticon very similarly collects ratings on requesters’ pay, communication (responsiveness to concerns), promptness (how fast was the work approved and paid) and fairness (in approving or rejecting the work). It was developed already in 2008, and as of 2019 is a worker-led non-profit organization. It was founded by Lilly Irani and Six Silberman.   

Further reading: For an interesting analysis why collective action among Turkers is not that common (back then) see [5]. They note that „collective action is difficult because of divided loyalties, time pressures to earn money, and risks that agitation poses to their reputations and to the availability of crowdwork more generally“.
