# Youtube – Fix Community Poll Feature

## Description

One youtuber (The Spiffing Brit) has noted in video from 2021 that some rapidly emerging Youtube channels make extensive use of the otherwise abandoned community function – a section on the channel where Youtubers can post general comments or polls not related to a specific video. Especially community polls (about random stuff) seem to reach many people, even beyond the own community.   
In his video Mr Spiffing Brit reports that he posted a few community polls himself and noticed that they reached a vast amount of viewers – far beyond the amount of his normal subscribers/views. He concludes that the youtube algorithm for whatever reason strongly promotes such community posts, even to people which are not the community itself.   
He calls to action to extensively use this community polls in order to ‚fix this broken feature‘. He suggests to exploit this feature and make extensive use of it before Youtube either deliberately changes the feature or it gets organically ranked down by the algorithm.
