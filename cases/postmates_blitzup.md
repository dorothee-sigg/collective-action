# Postmates BlitzUp Campaign

## Description

In May 2019 Postmates changed its pricing policy, namely removing the guaranteed pay of $4 per job and additionally cutting the per-mile rate [0]. This resulted in a pay cut of roughly 30% [1]. On June 15th 2019 workers organized a protest in reaction to that. The agreed on only accepting so called „Blitz“ offers – meaning that the pay is higher due to high demand. Additionally, workers demanded a $6 minimum pay per job, in addition to earning per-mile and tips.   
Even though this resembles a traditional strike at first glance it has a crucial difference: Workers could still earn money by accepting Blitz offers (typically, gig workers earn nothing when striking because they are officially independent workers). One experienced Postmates worker sees the BlitzUp campaign as a “creative way” to strike while still earning money [0]. Presumably they are hypothesizing that if workers stay offline unless there are Blitz orders the supply of workers is small enough that eventually normal orders will turn into Blitz orders – thereby exploiting the supply-demand-based pricing mode.    

## Aspects of Coordination

The campaign was organized by Working Washington [2] who set up a registration form to commit oneself for the strike [1]. They also provide a concrete action plan with detailed information not only what workers should do but also how customers can support the campaign [3]. Roughly 2,500 - 3,000 participated in the action [0,1].
