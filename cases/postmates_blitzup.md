# Postmates BlitzUp Campaign

## Description

In May 2019 Postmates changed its pricing policy, namely removing the guaranteed pay of $4 per job and additionally cutting the per-mile rate [0]. This resulted in a pay cut of roughly 30% [1]. On June 15th 2019 workers organized a protest in reaction to that. The agreed on only accepting so called „Blitz“ offers – meaning that the pay is higher due to high demand. Additionally, workers demanded a $6 minimum pay per job, in addition to earning per-mile and tips.   
Even though this resembles a traditional strike, but it has a crucial difference: Workers could still earn money by accepting Blitz offers (typically, gig workers earn nothing when striking because they are officially independent workers). One long-year Postmates worker sees the BlitzUp campaign as a “creative way” to strike while still earning money [0]. Presumably they are hypothesizing that if workers stay offline unless there are Blitz orders the supply of workers is small enough that eventually normal orders will turn into Blitz orders – thereby exploiting the supply-demand-based pricing mode.    

## Aspects of Coordination

The campaign was organized by Working Washington [2] who set up a registration form to commit oneself for the strike [1]. They also provide a concrete action plan with detailed information not only what workers should do but also how customers can support the campaign [3]. Roughly 2,500 - 3,000 participated in the action [0,1].
