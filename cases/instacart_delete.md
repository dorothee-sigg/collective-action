# Instacart – \#DeleteInstacart

## Description

In an open letter [0] a group of Instacart drivers (drivers are called Shoppers) set up several demands for better working conditions. Until these demands are met, the Instacart gig workers call on customers to delete the app as a sign of support. Under the hashtag #DeleteInstacart they tried to spread the word. The Guardian reports that the group behind the letter is oganized as the Gig Worker Collective [1].   
On medium the letter was published in September 2021. A quote from the letter:    
“Shoppers call upon every customer to delete the Instacart app immediately as a show of support for shoppers’ ongoing efforts to end Instacart’s long-standing practice of gig worker exploitation. We are asking customers to delete the app today — because there is only one thing Instacart and its executives and investors care about: money. And we ask that customers refrain from reinstalling the app unless and until Instacart rectifies the genuinely inequitable manner in which it treats its shoppers.”
