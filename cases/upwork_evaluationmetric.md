# Upwork – Evaluation Metrics

## Description

A big intransparency for freelancers on Upwork is the job recommendation algorithm which is based on different rating scores. Rahman (2019) [0] gives a very detailed analysis about the various issues with the jobs success score. Jarrahi and Sutherland (2019) [1] report that workers are trying to carefully curate the data that goes into it. For instance one participant could improve his hourly rate by altering the hours he reported to the platform, instead of indicating 4 hours of work he entered 4 x 1 hour. Another participant asks the clients to close and then reopen the contract in order to get more ratings for a long-term project. This helped him to maintain a stable score.
