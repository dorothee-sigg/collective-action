# Worker Info Exchange 

## Description

Worker Info Exchange (WIE) [0] is a non-profit organization based in the U.K. dedicated to research and advocacy of digital rights for workers and their trade unions. The overall idea is to help workers to collectivize their data in order to build collective power and tilt the balance towards workers. To that end they provide support for workers to make a data request from the gig platform – data which the gig platforms collected about them to make automated decisions on orders, pay and work conditions. Workers have a legal right to request and receive this data. Having access to this data is the foundation to challenge unfair decisions. 
Furthermore, WIE collects data from workers for research and data investigations to expose unfair algorithmic decision making and increase transparency over gig platform's algorithms, e.g. [1]. WIE also takes legal action which is supported by the workers' data.
