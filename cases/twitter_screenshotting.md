# Twitter – Screenshotting

## Description

Using Screenshots of posts (instead of the reply/retweet function) is a common practice on Twitter to (1) secure permanence (as criticized tweets are often removed later) and to (2) avoid unwanted attention and evade text searchability [0].   

## Aspects of Coordination

People developed the hashtag #UseScreenshots to spread this as a best practice. Also, Burrell et al. (2019) report that Twitter users comment and explain the strategies to unaware users, e.g. „Retweeting Trump amplifies his message by making his tweet rise higher […] if you must reference a Trump tweet please take a screen shot of his tweet“ [0].
