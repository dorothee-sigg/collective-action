# MozillaRally â€“ Collecting Browsing Data

## Description

Mozilla Rally [0] is/was a browser extension (no longer active) for Firefox where participating people could donate their data. In that way they conducted various studies (in collaboration with e.g. The Markup, Princeton University, Stanford University).   
One study about data privacy violations found that US tax filing websites send sensitive information to Facebook by collecting user browsing data [1] [2].
