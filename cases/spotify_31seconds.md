# Spotify – 31 Seconds of Silence

## Description

In 2014, the US-american indie band Vulfpeck uploaded their album ‚Sleepify‘ on Spotify, which consisted of 10 tracks. Each track played exactly 31 seconds of silence [0]. Spotify pays a fraction of a dollar per click (around $0.002 - $0.007 depending on the source [0,1]) – which only counts if the listener sticks to the song for 30 seconds. I could not find an official Spotify statement proving that but it seems to be common knowledge on the internet and among artists [0, 2].    
The band then asked their fanbase to listen to the album during nighttime, which could earn them around $4 per night per listener. In total they made around $20.000 with that project which they used for giving concerts. This means that fans listened to their album for roughly 5000 nights.   
About one month later, Spotify removed the album, complaining that it violates the company's terms of content.
