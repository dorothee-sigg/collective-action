# Instagram Collective Sensemaking

## Description

O’Meara describes in her paper ‚Weapons of the Chic: Instagram Influencer Engagement Pods as Practices of Resistance to Instagram Platform Labor‘ (2019) [0] how influencer on Instagram use so called engagement pods to collaboratively understand how Instagram’s algorithm works. An engagement pod is essentially a peer community to mutually like, comment or share each others content on Instagram. O’Meara reports that influencers use these pods to stay up to date about changes in the algorithm and continuously trying to decipher the blackbox. From an interview with an influencer:   
„So [the pod is about] having a space to talk about that with people who know different people than I do, who are trying different things and can kind of report back to each other.“
