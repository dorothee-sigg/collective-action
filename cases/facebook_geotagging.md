# Facebook – Remote Geotagging

## Description

In Fall 2016, Facebook users remotely geotagged themselves to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, based in North and South Dakota. With their collective check-ins the users aimed at supporting protesters fighting against an oil pipeline construction in Dakota. The remote check-ins should obfuscate the Facebook geolocation data of the protesters, allegedly monitored by the police. More than 1 million users joined.   
However it is unclear if the protest had the desired effect, police claimed that they did not track Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or elsewhere. [0,1]
