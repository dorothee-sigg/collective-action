The hacked software is shared online.|tractor-owner, software-hacker, mechanics| |information-based|exchange of individual strategies|
|Truck Drivers Facing Surveillance| |workers| |information-based|exchange of individual strategies|
|Instagram Joint Sensemaking|influencers "work collectively to attempt to decipher the logics of the algorithm by 'reporting back to each other' about the successes or fail- ures of their various experiments." (O'Meara, Weapons of the Chic)|content-providers|Social Media|information-based|sensemaking, exchange of individual strategies|

|MozillaRally |browser extension (no longer active) where participants could donate their data for web-based studies. One particular project collected data in order to demonstrate that US tax filing websites send sensitive information to Facebook|browser users|Search Engine related|information-based|aggregating data|
|Food Delivery in China – WeChat groups|On WeChat groups drivers share information about temporary subsidies, equipment assistance, newcomer help, real-time traffic news, help each other in emergencies, and collectively try to unpack the platforms’ algorithm
The biggest informal union is called the Knight League, a 2018 founded WeChat group, also known as Delivery Knights Alliance. It has more the status of an informal labor union. |workers|Gig Economy|information-based|sensemaking, exchange of individual strategies|
|Workers Info Exchange – Pooling Data| |workers|Gig Economy|information-based|aggregating data, data cooperative|
|Driver’s Seat Cooperative|Driver-owned data collection/analytics service. Calculating performance data for each driver, but according to Dubal (Alg. Wage Discrimination paper) they also sold the pooled data to cities to guide their decision making|workers|Gig Economy|information-based|aggregating data, data cooperative|
|WeClock|WeClock is a self-tracking app for drivers, in order to log the time (and presumably other measures) they spent working. One goal is to empower workers: "„WeClock is a great tool for campaigning! It equips workers with a way to quantify their workday. Use it to collect insights and advocate for the change that’s needed." (from website)|workers|Gig Economy|information-based|data cooperative|
|Postmates BlitzUp|As a reaction to a change in Postmates pricing policy (removing guaranteed pay) workers went on protest: Only accepting "Blitz" offers (higher paying orders due to high demand). This is more elaborate than a traditional strike. |workers|Gig Economy|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Amazon Flex Treephones|Amazon Flex drivers placed phones in trees outside of Whole Foods and Amazon delivery stations. Drivers can sync their phones to the tree-phones, thereby receiving location-specific offers (possibly before others do) without the need to wait in the parking lot in front of the supermarket (as is commonly done to be the first to receive location-specific offers). |workers|Gig Economy|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Uber Surge Club|Drivers collectively log out of the app to create an artificial shortage of work-supply. Prices increase due to Uber's surge pricing system based on supply and demand. After few minutes drivers log back into the app and benefit from the higher prices. |workers|Gig Economy|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Youtube – Community Poll Feature|One youtuber noticed that the Youtube community poll feature can be used to reach a vast amount of viewers, even outside your own community. He calls to action to extensively use this feature in order to "fix the broken feature", i.e. until either Youtube deliberately changes the feature or it gets organically ranked down by the algorithm.  |Youtubers|Social Media|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Spotify – 31 Seconds of Silence|In 2014, the band 'Vulfpeck' uploaded their album 'Sleepify' where each track consisted of 31 seconds of silence. The made around $20.000 by asking their fanbase to listen to the album at nighttime. Spotify pays per song once a listener sticks to it for 30 seconds. |Spotify users| |strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Spotify – Song Ranking |Brazilian singer Anitta asks her fans to push her song ‚Envolver‘ by repeated listening, making playlists with that song, and even using multiple accounts to do that. The song made it to the first place on the Spotify charts ranking. |Spotify users| |strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|DoorDash – #DeclineNow|Drivers reject low-paying deliveries (low means below a certain threhold) assuming that the algorithm will increase pay (like a reverse auction). |workers|Gig Economy|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|FoggySight – Facial Recognition Privacy|Anti-facial recobnition technology aiming to enhance privacy in facial lookup settings. The basic idea is that users can upload perturbed images – modified with respect to another user's image, however the changes are not visible for humans. This should confuse the facial recognition system and protect the identity of other users.Afaik, this exists so far only as an idea in a paper and is not implemented as, e.g. a browser extension. |users (e.g. for social media websites)| |strategy-based|obfuscation|
|Instacart – 22 cent Tips |At that time, Instacart used customers' tips to subsidize the wages for the workers. This could be circumvented by paying less tips upfront and then paying more tips in cash or in the app afterwards. Tipping 22 cents upfront was used as a signal for the driver that the customer knew what was going on – and that more tips could be expected. |workers, consumers/clients|Gig Economy|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Instacart – #DeleteInstacart|Workers asked customers to delete the app – because they didn't see another way out. |workers, consumers/clients|Gig Economy|strategy-based|other|
|Meituan & ele.me – Restaurant-Driver Cooperation|Driver - Restaurant cooperation: Newly opened restaurants play the role of the customer and place (artificial) orders, which are the "delivered" by the drivers. No food is prepared or delivered. As far as I understood this strategy is used to reach the requirements for a bonus payment as well as getting good scores (delivering in time for drivers, good ranking for restaurants). |workers, restaurants|Gig Economy|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Instagram Engagement Pods|An instagram/engagement pod is a group (or ‘pod’) of Instagram users who band together to help increase engagement on each other’s content. Specifically, most pods have a set of strict rules what each member has to do, e.g. liking or commenting in a certain timeframe after someone posted something.  |content-providers|Social Media|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Instagram Loop Giveaways|Instagram users can win a Giveaway (gift) if they follow all the instagram accounts involved in the loop. Those instagram accounts benefit by gaining new followers in a very short time.
Such a Loop Giveaway is either organized by influencer friends or – more recently, small influencers pay money to a big influencer to be part of the circle. |content-providers|Social Media|strategy-based|?|
|Upwork – Evaluation Metrics|Workers are asking clients to give them specific ratings or closing contracts earlier in order to get a rating. These evaluation metrices are very crucial in order to be ranked top or to get job suggestions by the algorithm. |workers, clients|Gig Economy|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Upwork – Off-Platform Work|Workers use the platform to get matched with a customer, the suggest to move off-platform. In this way they can avoid the commission fee and earn more money. However, this is not allowed by the platform and legal protections and insurances granted by the platform do not cover anymore. |workers, clients|Gig Economy|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Twitter – Screenshotting|In order to avoid unwanted attention twitter users use screenshots of other posts instead of the retweet/reply function. |content-providers (+ content-consumers)|Social Media|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Twitter – Voldemorting|Voldemorting refers to practice of not mentioning words or names in order to avoid a forced connection or unwanted attention. Instead, users oftentimes come up with alternative or invented words or names, which are usually understood/known by the subcommunity they want to reach.|content-providers (+ content-consumers)|Social Media|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Facebook – Remote Geotagging|In Fall 2016, facebook users remotely geotagged themselves to Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The users believed that their collective check-ins would support protesters fighting against an oil pipeline construction in Dakota and that the remote check-ins would obfuscate the Facebook geolocation data allegedly monitored by the police.|Facebook users|Social Media|strategy-based|obfuscation|
|Google Bombs|Websites originally unrelated to the search terms get ranked highly by heavy linking of search term and website.Most known google bombs are motivated by political activism, or commercial use. |Internet users|Search Engine related|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Link Schemes| | |Search Engine related|strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Waze – Traffic Routing|Waze collects navigation data from users and uses that to generate traffic routes. Two attempts to trick the system: (1) Berlin artists carried 100 cellphones over the streets, causing an artificial traffic jam. (2) Two students from Israel simulated user by programming bots, causing an artificial traffic jam on their campus. | | |strategy-based|algorithmic leverage|
|Twitter – Community Notes|As of 2022, Twitter provides the CommunityNotes feature, which can be seen as a kind of crowd-sourced fakenews moderation. Particiapting users can leave a 'community note' on a potentially misleading Tweet and if enough other users rate the note as useful it will be publicly shown on that Tweet. |Twitter users|Social Media| | |
|Fan Fiction Writers – Irreverent Stories|Fan fiction writers were upset about AI companies using their stories to train LLMs. Group of writers then published fake stories to confuse the data-collection services|workers| |strategy-based|data poisoning|
|AdNauseam|Browser extension with the goal to obfuscate browsing data and protect users from tracking by advertising networks. When installed, AdNauseam clicks in the background randomly on ads thereby producing obfuscating data. |browser users| | |obfuscation|
